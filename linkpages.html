A textile[1] is a flexible material made by creating an interlocking bundles of yarns or threads, which are produced by spinning raw fibers
(from either natural or synthetic sources) into long and twisted lengths.[2] Textiles are then formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting,
knotting, tatting, felting, bonding, or braiding these yarns together.
The related words "fabric"[3] and "cloth"[4] and "material" are often used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as
synonyms for textile. However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage. A textile is any material made of the
interlacing fibers, including carpeting and geotextiles, which may not necessarily be used in the production of further goods, such as
clothing and upholstery. A fabric is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, felting, stitching, crocheting or bonding that may
be used in the production of further products, such as clothing and upholstery, thus requiring a further step of the production. Cloth may
also be used synonymously with fabric, but often specifically refers to a piece of fabric that has been processed or cut.
Textiles are created from fibres and threads from natural or artificial materials. Textile includes threads, cords, nets, and a lot more. 
Textile fibres are made into fabrics using different methods like weaving, knitting, and felting.
The number of steps involved and the speed of production determine the cost of the fabrication process. To simply put, the fewer the steps
 and the quicker the process, the cheaper the fabric
Textile is the second basic needs of human being. It has such an important bearing on our daily lives that everyone needs to know something
 about them. From earliest times, people have used textiles of various types for covering, warmth, personal adornment, and even to display
 personal wealth. Today textiles are still used for these purposes and everyone is an ultimate consumer. Though we are not the direct purchaser
, we use it in our daily life. As for example, the buyers buy the product from the manufacturers, then they display in the shopping mall and 
then we buy the products to use.
Textile FibreMany industries, such as the auto mobile industry, are important consumers of textiles in various forms. Some other consumers are 
homemakers, dressmakers, and interior decorators. As well as students who are studying for these and various other occupations and professions
 in which knowledge of textile is of major importance.

Fibre
The textile industries use many different types of raw materials. Raw materials begin in agriculture with fibre production of cotton, flax, and other fibrous plants; in husbandry of sheep, other animals, and silkworms; in mining of metals and minerals.

What is textile
Yarn
The fibres are processed into yarns. The yarns are made into fabrics for industrial and consumer uses by various means, such as weaving and knitting.

Grey Fabric
The undyed and unfinished fabric is called grey cloth.

Finished Fabric
Grey fabrics are converted into finished fabrics, which provide particular appearance and performances.

End Product
Finished fabrics are made into end-use products, including apparel, home furnishings, and various industrial applications. These products are then merchandise and sold.

Sources And Types
Textiles are made from many materials. The materials can be classified into four groups – plant, animal, mineral and synthetics.

Plant
The fibres which comes from the plants is called plant fibres. Plant fibres are also called vegetable fibres. The plant fibres are listed below:
Cotton
Linen
Jute
Hemp
Sisal
Kapok
Ramie
Coir
Pina

Animal
There are several animal fibres, each obtained from different sources, but only two are recognized as major textile fibres. They are wool and silk. Minor hair fibres are listed below:
Camel
Alpaca
Mohair
Cashmere
Rabbit and
Qiviut

Mineral
Asbestos: Asbestos is a natural fibre obtained from varieties of rock. It is a fibrous form of silicate of magnesium and calcium, containing iron, aluminium, and other materials. It is acid proof, rust proof, and flame proof. Consequently it has been used for materials requiring certain of these characteristics.

Synthetics
These fibres are generated by man. We do not get these fibres from nature but are generated from natural (cellulose and protein) and chemical substances.  There are several categories of synthetic fibres: cellulosic, non-cellulosic polymers, protein, rubber, metallic, and mineral.

Uses Of Textile
Textiles have varieties of uses as follows –
The most common use is as clothing.
Also used for containers such as bags and baskets.
Household uses include carpeting, upholstery furnishings, bed coverings, pillow coverings, table cloths, mat, towels, blankets etc.
Miscellaneous uses include flags, tents, nets etc.
Transportation uses such as kites, sales, parachutes etc.
Technical textiles are used as structures of automobiles, medical textiles are used as gauze, bandages etc., agro-textiles are used for the 
protection of crops etc.
Traditional uses such as sewing, quilting and embroidery.
textile, any filament, fibre, or yarn that can be made into fabric or cloth, and the resulting material itself.

The term is derived from the Latin textilis and the French texere, meaning “to weave,” and it originally referred only to woven fabrics. It 
has, however, come to include 
fabrics produced by other methods. Thus, threads, cords, ropes, braids, lace, embroidery, nets, and fabrics made by weaving, knitting, bonding
, felting, or tufting are textiles. Some definitions of the term textile would also include those products obtained by the papermaking princip
le that have many of the properties associated with conventional fabrics.

Textiles and Design Quiz
How much do you know about the history of bell-bottoms? What about the origins of Hedwig glass? Test your knowledge of all aspects of the
 history of textiles and design.
This article surveys the development of textiles and the history and development of the textile industry. It treats in some detail the 
processes involved in the conversion of fibres to yarn, fabric construction, finishing operations applied to textiles, uses of textile 
materials, and the relationship between the producer and the consumer. Information about specific natural and synthetic textile fibres such as
wool, mohair, nylon, and polyester are treated in separate articles.

Development of textiles and the textile industry
From prehistoric times to the 19th century
Early textile production
Textile structures derive from two sources, ancient handicrafts and modern scientific invention. The earliest were nets, produced from one 
thread and employing a single repeated movement to form loops, and basketry, the interlacing of flexible reeds, cane, or other suitable
 materials. The production of net, also called limited thread work, has been practiced by many peoples, particularly in Africa and Peru. 
Examples of prehistoric textiles are extremely rare because of the perishability of fabrics. The earliest evidence of weaving, closely related
 to basketry, dates from Neolithic cultures of about 5000 BCE. Weaving apparently preceded spinning of yarn; woven fabrics probably originated
 from basket weaving. Cotton, silk, wool, and flax fibres were used as textile materials in ancient Egypt; cotton was used in India by 3000
 BCE; and silk production is mentioned in Chinese chronicles dating to about the same period. The history of spinning technology will be 
touched on below in the section Production of yarn: Spinning and that of weaving technology in the section Production of fabric.

Early fabrics
Many fabrics produced by the simple early weaving procedures are of striking beauty and sophistication. Design and art forms are of great
 interest, and the range of patterns and colours is wide, with patterns produced in different parts of the world showing distinctive local 
features.
